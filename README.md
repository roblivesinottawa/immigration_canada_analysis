- IMMIGRATION TO CANADA ANALYSIS

This is a practice analysis using data about immigration to Canada. This dataset was usedby IBM in their data analytics with Python course.

The project analyzes immigration to Canada starting in 1953. This is an important date because prior to the latter half of the 20th century, Canada only allowed
immigration from European nations and denied the entry of non-white immigrants.

We can see a decline in European immigration to Canada in the 1980s onward so we plot an analysis of from where people were immigrating to Canada. We
can then conclude that events that happened in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia led many people to seek asylum in Canada.

We can also notice that in the Americas, there are many Americans and some people from the Caribbean islands that have moved to Canada but not many 
from South America.


We start the project by importing the necessary libraries for calculations and plotting. Then we write the necessary code to visualize the data.
